## Using the Technologies

### Swiper
The `Hero.js` and `Home.js` components use the Swiper library to display carousels of technologies and service images. You can customize carousel settings by modifying the file.

### React Spring
Animations are implemented using React Spring in the `Home.js` component. You can add new animations or modify existing ones to create a more engaging user experience.

### React Router
Routing is managed through React Router to allow navigation between different pages of the application. Pages are organized in the `pages` folder and imported into the `App.js` file. You can add new pages or modify existing ones as needed for the project.

### EmailJS
EmailJS is integrated to enable sending emails directly from the client-side JavaScript. You can configure email templates and recipients according to your requirements.
